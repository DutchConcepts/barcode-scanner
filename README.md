⛔️ **_DEPRECATED_** ⛔️

This repository is now being hosted at the official [`@capacitor-community`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@capacitor-community/barcode-scanner). No worries, the only thing that's changed is the name. So updating to that version is easy. (It really is.)

Just run the following commands:

```bash
npm uninstall @dutchconcepts/capacitor-barcode-scanner
npm install @capacitor-community/barcode-scanner
npx cap sync
```

That's it 💯

See also the [release notes](https://github.com/capacitor-community/barcode-scanner/releases/tag/v1.2.1) in the new repository.
